# Integer Reversal

The **Integer Reversal** algorithm is designed to reverse a given integer. It takes an integer as input and returns the integer with its digits reversed.

### Usage:

```javascript
const reversedInteger = reverseInteger(12345);
console.log(reversedInteger); // Outputs: 54321

Feel free to adjust the `integerReversal` function or create additional test cases to suit your specific needs. This code serves as a simple example of how to approach the Fizz Buzz problem in JavaScript.
