# Popular JavaScript Algorithm Questions 

Welcome to the JavaScript Algorithms repository! This repo contains popular JavaScript algorithm questions and their solutions. Each algorithm is implemented in JavaScript, and I've provided clear explanations and examples to help you understand and learn these common algorithmic problems.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your coding skills through these challenges. Alternative approaches will be attempted along with their tradeoffs and runtime complexities.

## String Reversal

The **String Reversal** algorithm is designed to reverse a given string. Whether you're reversing a single word or an entire sentence, this function will help you quickly reverse the order of characters.

### Usage:

```javascript
const reversedString = reverseString("Hello, world!");
console.log(reversedString); // Outputs: "!dlrow ,olleH"
```

## Palindrome

The **Palindrome** algorithm checks if a given string reads the same forward and backward. This can be used to determine if a word or phrase is a palindrome.

### Usage:

```javascript
const isPalindrome = checkPalindrome("racecar");
console.log(isPalindrome); // Outputs: true
```
