# Popular JavaScript Algorithm Questions 

Welcome to the JavaScript Algorithms repository! This repo contains popular JavaScript algorithm questions and their solutions. Each algorithm is implemented in JavaScript, and I've provided clear explanations and examples to help you understand and learn these common algorithmic problems.

Feel free to explore, contribute, and enhance your coding skills through these challenges. Alternative approaches will be attempted along with their tradeoffs and runtime complexities.

5. [Anagram Checker](#anagram-checker)

## String Reversal

The **String Reversal** algorithm is designed to reverse a given string. Whether you're reversing a single word or an entire sentence, this function will help you quickly reverse the order of characters.

### Usage:

```javascript
const reversedString = reverseString("Hello, world!");
console.log(reversedString); // Outputs: "!dlrow ,olleH"
```

## Palindrome

The **Palindrome** algorithm checks if a given string reads the same forward and backward. This can be used to determine if a word or phrase is a palindrome.

### Usage:

```javascript
const isPalindrome = checkPalindrome("racecar");
console.log(isPalindrome); // Outputs: true
```

## Fizz Buzz

The **Fizz Buzz** algorithm is a classic programming problem. It prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of 3, it prints "Fizz" instead of the number, and for multiples of 5, it prints "Buzz" instead of the number. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5, it prints "FizzBuzz."

### Usage:

```javascript
fizzBuzz();
// Outputs:
// 1
// 2
// Fizz
// 4
// Buzz
// Fizz
// 7
// 8
// Fizz
// Buzz
// 11
// Fizz
// 13
// 14
// FizzBuzz
// 16
// ...
```

## Integer Reversal

The **Integer Reversal** algorithm is designed to reverse a given integer. It takes an integer as input and returns the integer with its digits reversed.

### Usage:

```javascript
const reversedInteger = reverseInteger(12345);
console.log(reversedInteger); // Outputs: 54321
```

## Anagram Checker

The **Anagram Checker** algorithm checks if two given strings are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as "listen" and "silent."

### Usage:

```javascript
const areAnagrams = checkAnagrams("listen", "silent");
console.log(areAnagrams); // Outputs: true
```
